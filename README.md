# LAB 28

**Author**: Joshua Fredrickson

**Version**: 1.0.0 

Lab 28


To use the Lab 28 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager), and [Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)  will need
 to be locally installed.  Once Node.js, npm, Mongo DB have been installed, install the Lab 13 files.  
 Prior to starting the Lab 28 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab 28 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run.   


This application was deployed with the following technologies.
Node.js, npm, body-parser, dotenv, express, faker, mongoose, winston, babel, superagent, 
http-errors, jest, eslint, JavaScript
